Figure out how to get last active students
    - figuring out when a student who dropped had last activity

intellij data - not everyone uses it
    - figure out how many people are using it
    - email possibly mismatched
        - github mapping

quiz duration data 
MPs are probbaly a predictor for dropping a course but less so for lectures

progress has timestamp and grades
intellij has begin and end timestamp

collect intellij by hours of day
graph of dates vs time spent on class for instance
    - or keystrokes

Notes:
unix times are in milliseconds


Priorities:
1. intellij students with score per minute (too slow)
2. Last active student day

db.MPGrades.find({'score.best': true, assignment: 'MP3', 'score.adjustedScore' : {$lt: 50}}, {email: 1, 'score.adjustedScore': 1}).sort({email: 1})

db.MPGrades.find({'score.best': true, assignment: 'MP4', 'score.adjustedScore' : {$lt: 50}}, {email: 1, 'score.adjustedScore': 1}).sort({email: 1})

db.best has emails and total percentages

seaborn - matplotlib wrapper?

turn the x axis into timestamps and normalize it

figuring out multiple line segment linear regression so that we can find the "inflection points" where the slope changes with ideally as few lines as possible
