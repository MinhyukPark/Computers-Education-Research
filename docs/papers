Learning Styles and Performance in the Introductory Programming Sequence
 - learning styles correlate significant disparity in performance
 - (active vs reflective, sensing vs intuitive, visual vs verbal, sequential vs global)
 - either ceirtain learning styles are better for learning OR the current method of teaching
   favors a certain learning style

Exploring the Role of Visualization and Engagement in Computer Science Education
 - Visualization technology is of little educational value no matter how well it is designed
 - unless it engages learners in an active learning activity
 - making predictions about future visualization, answering questions about the visualization 
 - constructing their own input data sets

Why Computing Students Learn on Their Own:Motivation for Self-Directed Learning of Computing
 - Projects, Social and peer interactions, Joy of learning, Fear

A Multi-National Study of Reading and  Tracing Skills in Novice Programmers
 - Either students lack the ability to problem sorve or have a fragile grasp of programming principles and tracing through code.
 - Study suggessts that students have a fragile grasp of skills. 

A multi-national, multi-institutional study of assessment of programming skills of first-year CS students 
 - Students after introductory computer science courses still don't know how to code

Why Students with an Apparent Aptitude for Computer Science Donâ€™t Choose to Major in Computer Science
 - Rejecting the major because of lack of desire to sit in front of a comptuer all day and because they had already chosen another major.
 - Men choos ebecause of computer games
 - Women choose it to use it in other fields
