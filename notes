Figure out how to get last active students
    - figuring out when a student who dropped had last activity

intellij data - not everyone uses it
    - figure out how many people are using it
    - email possibly mismatched
        - github mapping

quiz duration data 
MPs are probbaly a predictor for dropping a course but less so for lectures

progress has timestamp and grades
intellij has begin and end timestamp

collect intellij by hours of day
graph of dates vs time spent on class for instance
    - or keystrokes

Notes:
unix times are in milliseconds


Priorities:
1. intellij students with score per minute
